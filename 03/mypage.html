	<h1>It's My Life</h1>

	<hr>

	<p>
		This ain't a song for the broken-hearted<br>
		No silent prayer for faith-departed<br>
		And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd<br>
		You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud<br>
		It's my life<br>
		It's now or never<br>
		But I ain't gonna live forever<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		(It's my life)<br>
		My heart is like an open highway<br>
		Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		It's my life<br>
		Yeah, this is for the ones who stood their ground<br>
		For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down<br>
		Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake<br>
		Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks<br>
		It's my life<br>
		And it's now or never<br>
		I ain't gonna live forever<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		(It's my life)<br>
		My heart is like an open highway<br>
		Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		'Cause it's my life<br>
		Better stand tall when they're calling you out<br>
		Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down<br>
		It's my life<br>
		And it's now or never<br>
		'Cause I ain't gonna live forever<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		(It's my life)<br>
		My heart is like an open highway<br>
		Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		And it's now or never<br>
		I ain't gonna live forever<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		(It's my life)<br>
		My heart is like an open highway<br>
		Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"<br>
		I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
		'Cause it's my life<br>
